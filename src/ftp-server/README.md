Going through the specific requirements and match them with the current implementation details:

### Requirements:

1. **Monitor a Protected File**:
   - The program should monitor a specified text file for any changes or deletions.
   
2. **Detect Changes or Deletion**:
   - When a change or deletion is detected, the program should download the correct version from an online repository (FTP server).
   
3. **Hash or Date-based Detection**:
   - The program can use a hash (like MD5) to detect changes. Alternatively, it could use file modification dates.
   
4. **FTP Client Implementation**:
   - The program must use raw sockets and FTP commands, not pre-existing FTP client functionality.
   
5. **Handling File Locks**:
   - The program should handle cases where the protected file is locked by an editor. It should not fail due to this sharing violation and should update the file once it becomes writeable.
   
6. **Polling**:
   - The program can use polling to check the file status periodically.
   
7. **Logging**:
   - For demonstration purposes, the program should log events verbosely in its own window.

### Current Implementation Review:

1. **Monitor a Protected File**:
   - The current implementation monitors a file specified by the `LOCAL_FILE` environment variable.

2. **Detect Changes or Deletion**:
   - The implementation uses MD5 hash to detect changes and re-downloads the file if the hash differs.

3. **Hash-based Detection**:
   - The `get_file_hash` function computes the MD5 hash of the file, which is used to detect changes.
   
4. **FTP Client Implementation**:
   - The implementation uses raw sockets to communicate with the FTP server, sending and receiving FTP commands directly.

5. **Handling File Locks**:
   - The implementation doesn't explicitly handle file locks. It needs modification to catch and handle exceptions related to file access issues.

6. **Polling**:
   - The `monitor_file` function uses `time.sleep(POLL_INTERVAL)` to poll the file status at regular intervals.

7. **Logging**:
   - The implementation uses `print` statements for logging events, which can be seen in the console for demonstration purposes.

### Improvements Needed:

1. **Handling File Locks**:
   - Add handling for file locks to ensure the program does not fail due to sharing violations and retries until it can replace the file.

2. **Known-Good Hash Storage**:
   - Store and update the known-good file's hash on the FTP server to verify integrity after updates.

### Suggested Improvements to Implementation:

Here is the modified code to include handling for file locks and update the hash check from the server:

```python
Code.
```

### Summary of Changes:
1. **FTP Server Hash File**:
   - Added `ftp_get_remote_hash` to download the hash file from the FTP server and use it for verification.

2. **Exception Handling**:
   - The `monitor_file` function includes try-except blocks to handle any file access issues, ensuring the program does not fail due to sharing violations.

3. **Polling Interval**:
   - Ensured `POLL_INTERVAL` is read as an integer.

With these changes, the program aligns strictly with the specified requirements and handles all necessary functionality, including monitoring, detection, and FTP-based restoration.

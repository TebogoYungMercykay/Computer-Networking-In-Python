# Hamming Code (Data Link Layer)

## Definition
Hamming code is an error-detection and error-correction method used in data communication. It uses parity bits to check and correct errors in data transmission.

## How it Works
1. **Parity Bits:** Hamming code uses parity bits to protect a certain set of bits. Based on which parity bits have changed, you can determine which bit has changed.
2. **Even Parity:** In the example given, even parity is used. This means that the total number of 1's in a set (including the parity bit) should be even.
3. **Error Correction:** If a bit is received incorrectly (e.g., it's flipped from 1 to 0), the parity bits can be used to identify and correct the error.

## Hamming Code Structure
1. **Single Bit Error Correction:** The basic Hamming code can correct single bit errors. This is done by placing each data bit in two sets, each protected by a parity bit.
2. **Multiple Bit Error Correction:** To correct multiple bit errors, the Hamming code needs to be extended. This involves using more sets and parity bits.

## Role of Hamming Code in the Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer is responsible for error detection and correction in data transmission. Hamming code is one method it can use to achieve this, ensuring that data is transmitted accurately and reliably.

#### Key Insights

- Hamming codes use parity to protect specific sets of bits and determine which bit has changed during transmission errors.
- The mechanism to correct a single bit error involves using parity bits and intersections of sets to identify the incorrect bit.
- Binary counting is used to indicate the combinations of sets and intersections in Hamming codes.
- Hamming codes require calculating and transmitting both parity and data bits in a specific bit sequence.
- Error correction in Hamming codes involves checking the received bit string and using the calculated parity bits to identify and correct the error.
- Hamming codes are limited in their ability to correct multiple bit errors, and the presence of damaged parity bits can impact error correction.

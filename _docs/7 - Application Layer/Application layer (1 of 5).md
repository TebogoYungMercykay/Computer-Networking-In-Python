# Application Layer Protocols (Application Layer)

## Definition
The application layer is the seventh layer of the OSI model and it provides the interface between the applications we use to communicate and the underlying network over which our messages are transmitted. Application layer protocols are used to exchange data between programs running on the source and destination hosts.

## Common Application Layer Protocols
1. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** This is used for transmitting webpages over the Internet. It is a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model.
2. **HTTPS (Secure HTTP):** This is a secure version of HTTP, where communication is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** This is used for transferring files between an client and server on a network. FTP uses the client-server model and two TCP connections for the control and data transfer.
4. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** This is used for sending emails. SMTP is generally used to send messages from a mail client to a mail server.
5. **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** These are used for receiving emails. POP3 is used to download emails from the server to the client. IMAP allows multiple clients to manage the same mailbox on the server.
6. **DNS (Domain Name System):** This is used for resolving domain names to IP addresses. DNS serves to translate human-friendly domain names into the numerical IP addresses to locate and identify computer services and devices.
7. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** This is used for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses, for interfaces and services.
8. **Telnet:** This is used for executing commands on remote computers. Telnet provides a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication via a virtual terminal connection.
9. **SSH (Secure Shell):** This is a secure version of Telnet. SSH provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communication between two computers connected over an open network.
10. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):** This is used for managing devices on IP networks. SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration.

## Role of Application Layer
The application layer is responsible for:
1. **Identifying communication partners:** The application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application. This process is known as name resolution.
2. **Determining resource availability:** The application layer has to check if sufficient network resources for the requested communication exist or not.
3. **Synchronizing communication:** The application layer ensures all communication between applications is properly sequenced and synchronized. This includes initiating a session between applications, maintaining the session, and synchronizing dialogue between the applications.


#### Key Insights
- [1] RFCs are essential for understanding application layer protocols and should be thoroughly read. Telnet is a useful tool for interacting with protocols.
- [2] HTTP is a request-response protocol used for web browsing, and Telnet can be used to send HTTP requests and analyze responses.
- [3] SMTP is a protocol for email transfer, and Telnet can be used to simulate sending email messages.
- [4] HTTP response codes provide information about the status of a request, and it's important to understand their meanings.
- [5] Reading RFCs and conducting experiments with protocols are crucial for gaining practical knowledge and understanding the nuances of application layer protocols.
- [6] Telnet can be used to send commands and interact with servers, allowing users to understand how protocols work in practice.
- [7] Following the RFCs and conducting experiments is essential for successfully implementing application layer protocols and troubleshooting network issues.

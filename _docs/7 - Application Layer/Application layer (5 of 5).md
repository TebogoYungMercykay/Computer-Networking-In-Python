# X11 / Distributed Systems (Application Layer)

## Definition
X11, also known as X Window System, is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. X11 provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard.

A distributed system is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to each other.

## X11 in Distributed Systems
X11 is designed to be used over network connections, which makes it a key part of many distributed systems. It allows for the use of graphical applications on a remote server, while the graphical user interface is displayed on the local machine.

## How X11 Works
1. **X Server:** The X server is responsible for all hardware interaction like drawing on the screen and accepting user input. The server runs on the computer where the display is attached.
2. **X Clients:** X clients are applications that interface with the X server to create windows and handle user input. The clients can run on the same computer as the server or on a different computer, communicating over the network.
3. **Window Manager:** The window manager is a special type of X client that controls the appearance of windows. It handles user commands like resizing, moving, and closing windows.

## X11 and the Application Layer
X11 operates at the application layer of the OSI model. It provides a standard protocol for creating graphical user interfaces, which is used by many different types of applications. This makes it a key part of the application layer in many Unix-like operating systems.

#### Key Insights

- The X server enables the display of graphical outputs from a central service on various terminals, expanding the concept of client-server architecture.
- X allows different users to receive customized graphical outputs based on their specific needs and requirements, enhancing the flexibility and usability of distributed systems.
- X broadens the scope of distributed systems by enabling interaction with services provided at different locations throughout the network, allowing users to obtain relevant information from various sources.
- Ergonomics plays a crucial role in designing displays, ensuring that information is presented in a manner that makes sense to the user and facilitates quick and easy comprehension.
- X can be used in various contexts, including automobiles, aircraft, and industrial facilities, to display information to different users and enable efficient monitoring and control.
- The X server facilitates the push of information to multiple parties, ensuring that each user receives the relevant data in a format suitable for their specific needs, promoting effective communication and collaboration.
- X serves as a powerful tool in creating distributed systems, allowing for the seamless integration of multiple display units and the efficient sharing of information across various platforms and locations.
